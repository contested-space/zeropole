# zeropole
## Synopsis
The goal of that project is to make a static filter generator. Once an adequate filter is found, its code can be generated
for Faust or JSFX (code generation not yet implemented). In it's actual state, it can be used to visually understand how 
zero-pole analysis works. 

## Installation 

Right now the only dependencies are python and wxpython, but audio DSP will be handled by the PYO library available at
http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/

Simply run 
python ZeroPoleApp
